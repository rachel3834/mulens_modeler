SWIFT Microlensing
==================

Target visibility tool:
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Tools/viewing/viewing.pl

Used central-Bulge location from middle of HCZ as default sky position:
OGLE-BLG505	17:57:34	-29:13:15

* How many microlensing targets would reach measureable magnitudes?

* What signature would we expect to see, relative to Earth-based observations?

* What can we measure?  What if we do this in parallel with K2 or Spitzer?

* What advantages does SWIFT offer?
